## Hello there 
I am a junior backend developer, that also acts as frontend from time to time (mostly, when I decide I want to run my programs from the browser lol).

Right now, coding is a hobby, but soon enough I hope it becomes more than just that. 

I am very interested about the whole .NET environment, and OOP is my favorite paradigm. However, mental stimulation can be very motivational for me, I feel really good when I start to understand something that once felt exhausting to learn. So, even though I am kind of a Microsoft *fangirl* (jk), I am open to develop with any language if given the challenge.
